Modest Physics Calculator

A physics calculator that includes calculations for Average Speed, Acceleration, Density, Newton's Second Law (Force), Power, Weight, Pressure, Kinetic Energy, Ohm's Law and Frequency.

How to use

    * Open the calculator by running the main.py file.

    * Input the formula you want to calculate (e.g. "average speed", "acceleration", "density", "frequency" etc.)

    * Input the required data for the calculation.

    * Press "Enter" to see the result.

    * To exit the program, enter "exit"

Formulas and concepts

    * Average Speed : Speed = Distance/Time
    * Acceleration : Acceleration = (Final Velocity - Initial Velocity) / Time
    * Density : Density = Mass / Volume
    * Newton's Second Law (Force) : Force = Mass * Acceleration
    * Power : Power = Work / Time
    * Weight : Weight = Mass * Gravity
    * Pressure : Pressure = Force / Area
    * Kinetic Energy : Kinetic Energy = 1/2 * Mass * Velocity^2
    * Ohm's Law : Voltage = Current * Resistance
    * Frequency : Frequency = Velocity / Wavelength
